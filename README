This plugin provides the ability to encrypt a column of the database table which you can safely expose in the URL.
Provides handy method to make DB calls (Rails way of calling ya know !)

After Installation you can put the encryptor key in your environment.rb file:

UrlEncrypt.encryptors("abcdefghijklmnop", "mnbkjhkhkhkhkhkjhkjh") -> so that KEY and IV for Cipher encryption are different

OR

UrlEncrypt.encryptors("abcdefghijklmnop") -> so that KEY and IV for Cipher encryption are same

OR 

NOTHING -> so that plugin takes care of hanving its own


Example
=======
class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  column :id, :integer
  column :title, :string
  
  encrypted :with => :title
end

Ypu have handy methods:

Book.find_by_encrypted_title('encrypted string')

Book.find_by_encrypted_title('encrypted string', :conditions => ["any other condition can go here"])
